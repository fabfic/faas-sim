faas-sim: A trace-driven Function-as-a-Service simulator
========================================================

Faas-sim is a powerful trace-driven simulation framework to simulate container-based function-as-a-service platforms.
It can be used to develop, and evaluate the performance of operational strategies for such systems, like scheduling, autoscaling, load balancing, and others.
faas-sim was developed at the [Distributed Systems Group](https://dsg.tuwien.ac.at) at TU Wien as part of a larger research effort surrounding serverless edge computing systems.

High-level architecture
-----------------------

faas-sim is based on the [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io) discrete-event simulation framework.
It uses [Ether](https://github.com/edgerun/ether) as network simulation layer, and to create cluster configurations and network topologies.
By default, it uses the [Skippy](https://github.com/edgerun/skippy-core) scheduling system for resource scheduling,
but schedulers, autoscalers, and load-balancers can be plugged in by the user.
faas-sim is trace-driven, and relies on profiling data from workloads and devices to simulate function execution.
It comes pre-packaged with traces from several common computing devices and representative cluster workloads.
The following figure shows a high-level overview:

Run examples
------------

You can run the examples we provide in https://github.com/edgerun/faas-sim/tree/master/examples by first creating a virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies.

    make venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python -m examples.<example>.main

Where example refers to the specific example package.
Check out the examples [README](https://github.com/edgerun/faas-sim/tree/master/examples/README.md) for more information.

Run notebooks
-------------

Notebooks are located in `notebooks`.
You need to install `faas-sim` in editable state to run the notebooks.
Inside `notebooks` import modules from `sim`.

To install the project (assuming you already created and activated a virtual environment via `make venv`):

      pip install -e .
      jupyter notebook

Development
-----------

The simulator has seen a major refactoring in the branch `/feature/adapt-to-galileo-faas` and aims to be compatible with the other galileo projects.
Only this branch is in active development.
